The purpose of this app is for me to keep track of where my money is going each month. One of the main features of this app is the ability to set an expense as a recurring monthly bill. Many of the costs we make, such as rent, subscriptions, insurance, or internet, recur on the same day every month. I wanted a way to track these automatically without needing to add them repeatedly. When I enter a new expense, I can check a box that marks it as recurring for the rest of the year. Once I do that, the app automatically creates the same expense for each remaining month, keeping the same amount, merchant name, category, and payment method. This helps keep my spending records complete and consistent, especially for planning and understanding long term trends. Instead of manually entering something like rent twelve times, I can record it once. This feature makes the app a lot more practical for real life budgeting and makes everything more accurate since recurring bills account for a big portion of monthly spending.
